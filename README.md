# Algorithms & Data Structures in JavaScript.

This repository has been made while learning [from this tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/) by [Stephen Grider](https://twitter.com/ste_grider). 

That being said, I am planning to update this project with some more questions by learning [from this tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) by [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/).

This repository started its origin as a fork from [this repository's starter boilerplate](https://github.com/StephenGrider/AlgoCasts/tree/master/exercises). That being said, the solution code is all written by me while learning from tutorial with my [preferred coding style](./.eslintrc.js).

## Where are Questions and their respective Answers? What about Tests?

- **Question:** All folders have specific `README.md` where respective question has been asked.
- **Answers:** All folders have specific `index.js` where respective answer has been solved.
- **Tests:** All folders have specific `test.js` which contains respective test file. Use Jest for same as mentioned below.

## Test with Jest

Step1:  Install Jest

```bash
npm install -g jest
```

Step2: Run Jest into the targeted test such as

```bash
jest 007-anagrams/test.js --watch
```
